# C++ Object-Oriented Examples

Hi there! Welcome to my repository. This is a collection of simple C++ programs that show how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) works. The examples in this repo will help you understand the basic concepts of OOP, like classes, objects, inheritance, and more.

## What You'll Learn

This repo includes examples of the following OOP concepts:

- **Classes & Objects**: Learn how to define classes and create objects in C++.
- **Inheritance**: Understand how to create new classes based on existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: See how to use functions and operators in different ways.
- **Encapsulation**: Learn how to protect data inside classes and hide unnecessary details.
- **Abstraction**: Get to know how to make complex things easier to use.

## Project Structure

The repo is organized into two main folders:

- **Implementasi_OOP**: This folder contains C++ examples using OOP concepts like classes and inheritance.
- **Implementasi_selain_OOP**: Here, you'll find examples of regular C++ programs that don't focus on OOP.

## Requirements

To run the examples in this repository, you will need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`).
- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or VSCode with C++ support).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your computer:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/daffarizki190/Cpp-ObjectOriented-Examples.git
2. Go to the folder where the program is located:
   ```
   cd Cpp-ObjectOriented-Examples/Implementasi_OOP
3. Compile the C++ program:
   ```
   g++ -o my_program my_example.cpp
5. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./my_program
